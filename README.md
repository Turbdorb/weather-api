# <weather-api>

## Description

I created this weather api to help me track the weather in different cities. Building this project was a good exorcize in using Web APIs with a real world application. This weather api will be useful to see the weather forecast for today, and for the next 5 days. This project helped me learn how to use Web APIs, and how to better use Bootstrap.
